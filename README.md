## How it was

While using React hooks wasn't that difficult since it's not my first project, the need to use it that much made it very harder. I spent hours debugging problems caused by hooks calling hooks and/or dependecies. Also, updating the layout in code to fit client's view was difficult. This was the first time I used Firebase Storage and I thought it was smooth. There are some problems in the code in the way I made and now I can think of better ways to do it, but that's the purpose of trying. Hope you like it!
